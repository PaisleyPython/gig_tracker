initial idea: 
Create web Application with the django framework to allow users to vote in a poll system on their availability for 
date requests. Users will receive text prompt with link to poll. If users dont vote, then every 24hours they will receive another text prompt until vote is complete. 
Once date has been added, then it will be added to confirmed page, which ideally will have link to a google calander API. 


TODO: 

- Create form for poll request
- Create form for gig details

- create new branch in order to work on authorisation. 
- Fix header with icons
- Figure out writing script for itegration with text message api service
- Look to integrate google API for calendar
- User Log in page
- Ensure user can only vote once per date
- have requirements for core band members. (drums, guitars, vocals, and 2 brass)




design: 

Application is going to utilise SQLite

In our poll app, we’ll create two models: Question and Choice. A Question has a question and a publication date. A Choice has two fields: the text of the choice and a vote tally. Each Choice is associated with a Question.

The name of each Field instance (e.g. question_text or pub_date) is the field’s name, in machine-friendly format. You’ll use this value in your Python code, and your database will use it as the column name.

You will then be prompted for your desired email address:

The final step is to enter your password. You will be asked to enter your password twice, the second time as a confirmation of the first.

Password (again): *********

==========================================

The logic of gig acceptance.. 

There needs to be a minimum requirement of accepted members with some considered core. 
Once threshold has been reached, gig will automatically get accepted and uploaded to the confimed page. 
text message notifications then need to be triggered and send to the members. 
I would also then like for the gmail calendar to be updated if this is possible..
